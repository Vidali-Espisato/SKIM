# SKIM

## Description

A platform where content is curated, moderated and managed by the members. A user can connect their Solana wallet to have a read-only view of the content available.
S/he can join us after minting an NFT, whether to become a Member (who can create posts) or to become a Moderator (who can delete a post or upvote posts to bring it to the top).
